# Project Summary: GitHub Repositories Dashboard

## 1. Overview

This project is a web application that displays a dashboard of a user's GitHub repositories. It provides a centralized view of all repositories, allowing the user to quickly assess their projects, view key metrics, and explore repository details.

The application is built with modern web technologies, including React, TypeScript, and Vite, and is styled with Tailwind CSS. It fetches repository data from a JSON file that is generated by a script, and it is designed to be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Repository Dashboard**: Displays a list of all of the user's repositories in a card-based layout.
*   **Detailed View**: Clicking on a repository card opens a modal with detailed information, including the README file, language statistics, and the content of major files.
*   **Search and Filtering**: Users can search for repositories by name or description, filter by programming language, and sort by last updated, number of stars, or name.
*   **Summary Statistics**: The dashboard displays the total number of repositories, stars, and forks.
*   **Automated Data Fetching**: A Node.js script (`scripts/fetch-repos.js`) uses the GitHub API to fetch repository data and saves it to a JSON file (`public/repos-data.json`). This script is designed to be run automatically by a GitHub Actions workflow.
*   **Automated Deployment**: The project is configured for automated deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## 3. Technical Stack

*   **Frontend**:
    *   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
    *   **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
    *   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
    *   **react-syntax-highlighter**: A component for syntax highlighting code.
*   **Backend/Tooling**:
    *   **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for running the data fetching script.
    *   **GitHub REST API**: Used to fetch repository data.
    *   **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).
    *   **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the application.

## 5. How It Works

1.  **Data Fetching**: The `scripts/fetch-repos.js` script is run, either manually or by the GitHub Actions workflow. This script authenticates with the GitHub API using a personal access token, fetches data for all of the user's repositories, and saves the relevant information to `public/repos-data.json`.
2.  **Frontend Application**: The React application, with `src/App.tsx` as its main component, fetches the data from `public/repos-data.json`.
3.  **UI Rendering**: The application renders the repository data, providing the user with a dashboard, search, filtering, and sorting capabilities.
4.  **Deployment**: The GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds the React application and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

## 6. Setup and Usage

1.  **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2.  **Fetch Data**: `npm run fetch-repos` (requires a GitHub token)
3.  **Run Development Server**: `npm run dev`
4.  **Build for Production**: `npm run build`
